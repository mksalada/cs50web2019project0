## Features
For this Project 0: Homepage, I made and designed a *personal or portfolio website about myself with a blog* subjected to the following requirements listed [here](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html#requirements).

*    My website contained four different ```.html``` pages, and you could get any page on my website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks;
*    One ordered and five unordered lists, one table, and fifteen images;
*    Five stylesheet file (one ```.css```, three ```.scss``` file and one ```.css.map``` file).
*    I used fourteen different CSS properties for my stylesheet(s), and six different types of CSS selectors. I used five ```#id``` and six ```.class``` selectors.
*    My stylesheet(s) have nine mobile-responsive ```@media``` query.
*    I used Bootstrap 4 on my website, taking advantage of four of the Bootstrap components, and using four Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
*    My stylesheets must used six SCSS variable, six SCSS nesting, and six SCSS inheritance.
*   My website have a ```README.md``` file describing my project.

## Additional Features and Contents
To create this website, I added some features listed below:

*   I used my FontAwesome Kit for the navigation menu and footer icons.
*   For Bootstrap NavBar menu to work, I added scripts of jQuery and Bootstrap JS.
*   The photos I used for the blog pages are free photos from [Pixaby](https://pixabay.com/). They are not mine and just used them for this project.
*   The photos found in the portfolio section of the home page or ```index.html``` are screenshot of websites I've found online. They are not mine and just used them for this project also.
* For fonts, I used *Zilla Slab*, *Roboto Slab* and *Sans Serif*, and all from Google Fonts.

## Screencast
I recorded a 5-minute screencast in which I demonstrated my web app’s functionality and/or walk viewers through my code. Here's the YouTube video: [https://youtube.com/watch?=salada4299](https://youtube.com/watch?=salada4299).
